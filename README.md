# ü§ñ AI Tools Usage Summary

Before using AI tools, I first tried to solve each problem through **Google searches**, **OpenLayers documentation**, and manual code testing.  
After spending time experimenting and researching, I used **ChatGPT** mainly to understand specific technical issues, organize layout structure, and improve visual consistency.

| Area | Specific Issue | Learned / Resolved with AI | AI Tools Used | AI Usage (Estimated Time) |
|------|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **Map Layout Issue** | The OpenLayers map covered the entire page and left no room for text or image sections. | Learned how to wrap the map within a **container box** using CSS and define its width and height, so other areas of the page could be reserved for additional content. | ChatGPT | ~10 Minutes |
| **Navbar Text Color** | The ‚ÄúMy Web Page‚Äù text in the navigation bar could not be styled because its color was not properly defined. | Learned how to assign a specific **CSS color property** to the navbar class, enabling full control of the text color. | ChatGPT | ~5 Minutes |
| **Deployment Setup** | The site didn‚Äôt appear correctly on GitHub Pages due to branch setup and cache issues. | Understood the **GitHub Pages** configuration process and refreshed deployment with correct file structure and path settings. | ChatGPT | ~30 Minutes |

**Total AI Usage:** ~45‚Äì50 minutes (across 3 days)

# üß† Summary of AI Usage

ChatGPT was mainly used to:
- Adjust the **OpenLayers map layout** by placing it inside a styled container, allowing more flexible page design  
- Solve the **navbar color definition problem**, enabling consistent text styling across the website  
- Clarify how to **restructure and redeploy** the website correctly on GitHub Pages  

AI support focused on **layout organization, color control, and deployment understanding**, helping improve both the website‚Äôs design and functionality.  
It was used as a **learning tool**, not for code generation ‚Äî ensuring that every solution was applied manually with full understanding.
